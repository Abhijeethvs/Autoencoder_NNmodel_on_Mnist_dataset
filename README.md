# Project Title: Autoencoder Image Reconstruction on MNIST Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for an image reconstruction project using autoencoders on the MNIST dataset. An autoencoder is a type of neural network that learns to encode and decode data efficiently, making it a valuable tool for image reconstruction tasks.

Key Features:
MNIST Dataset: The project is based on the MNIST dataset, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

Autoencoder Model: We have implemented an autoencoder neural network with encoder and decoder components. The encoder compresses the input images into a lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder reconstructs the original images from this encoding.

Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on a subset of MNIST images and evaluated on a separate testing set.

Visualization: The repository includes code for visualizing the encoding and decoding process, as well as comparing original and reconstructed images.

Results:
We present the results of our experiments with autoencoder architectures, highlighting the impact on image reconstruction quality. You can find detailed conclusions and visual comparisons in the provided documentation.
